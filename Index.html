                                <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4" style={{ color: colors.grayText }}>
                                    Before you share *any* content generated by an AI tool, whether internally with colleagues or externally with clients/partners, **always review it carefully**. Make sure it doesn't accidentally contain or hint at any sensitive Deleum information. AI can sometimes "hallucinate" or generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or confidential details.
                                    <br /><span className="text-sm italic text-gray-500">Example: If an AI tool helps you draft a client email, carefully check that it doesn't accidentally include internal project codes or client-specific financial details that haven't been approved for external sharing.</span>

                                <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4" style={{ color: colors.grayText }}>
                                    If you ever accidentally share sensitive information with an AI tool, **do not panic, but act fast!** Immediately report the incident to the **ICT Department** or your superior. Swift action is crucial for mitigating any potential risks and ensuring data integrity.

                                <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4" style={{ color: colors.grayText }}>
                                    A crucial step to prevent AI tool providers from using our shared content to further train their models (and potentially expose our data) is to manage your tool settings:
                                </p>
                                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-md mb-6" style={{ color: colors.grayText }}>
                                    <li>
                                        **Enable Data Restriction:** Ensure you enable the feature within the AI tool that restricts data usage for model training. This is typically found in the settings or privacy section of the AI tool (e.g., in ChatGPT, look for "Data Controls" or "Chat History & Training" and toggle off data sharing).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        **Delete Your History:** After each usage session, make it a habit to delete your search or conversation history within the AI tools. This helps keep our interactions private and minimizes the footprint of our data.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                            <li>**No Company-Related Information:** Crucially, personal use must **never** involve the disclosure or processing of any company-related information, even if it's not strictly "sensitive." This includes project details, client names, internal processes, or any data that could be linked back to Deleum.</li>

                                    The distinction between work and personal use helps ensure that company resources are used appropriately and that our security protocols are not inadvertently bypassed. Remember, any data processed by an AI tool, even for personal use on a company device, might be subject to Deleum's IT policies and monitoring.

                                        **Clarity and Simplicity:** Strive for clear, concise, and simple language to ensure the content is accessible to a broad audience, including those with varying linguistic proficiencies or cognitive abilities.

                                    When using AI tools, it's essential to understand the implications for intellectual property (IP). The content AI tools generate might be subject to copyright laws, and its use must align with Deleum's intellectual property policies.

                                        **Attribution of Sources:** Always properly attribute the source of the content you use, especially if it's derived from publicly available information processed by AI. While AI generates new content, it does so based on existing data, and original sources should be acknowledged where appropriate.
                                        <br /><span className="text-sm italic text-gray-500">Example: If you ask an AI to summarize a published research paper, ensure you cite the original paper in your internal report.</span>

                                        **Ownership of AI-Generated Content:** The legal landscape around the ownership of AI-generated content is still evolving. At Deleum, any work product created by an employee in the course of their employment, even with the assistance of AI tools, is generally considered the property of Deleum. However, this does not grant Deleum ownership over the underlying AI model or the data it was trained on.

                                        **Proprietary Information Input:** As emphasized in Chapter 3, never input Deleum's confidential intellectual property (e.g., trade secrets, proprietary algorithms, unpatented designs for our specialized products in Oilfield Services or Integrated Offshore Engineering Solutions) into public AI tools. Doing so could lead to the unintended disclosure and loss of Deleum's IP.

This includes creating fake news, fabricated reports, or deceptive marketing claims. Always verify AI-generated facts against reliable sources before using them.
                                        <br /><span className="text-sm italic text-gray-500">Example: Do not use AI to create a misleading report about a competitor's performance or to inflate Deleum's project statistics.</span>

                                        **Properly Stored:** If AI-generated content is intended for official use or needs to be retained, it must be saved in designated Deleum systems (e.g., shared drives, document management systems) according to standard company procedures. Do not rely solely on the AI tool's internal chat history for official record-keeping.
